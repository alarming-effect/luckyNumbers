# luckyNumbers
checks for lucky or cool numbers and returns 1 = "almost", 2 = "lucky', or 0 = "not lucky or cool"

"7777...8?!??!", exclaimed Bob, "I missed it again! Argh!" Every time there's an interesting number coming up, he notices and then promptly forgets. Who doesn't like catching those one-off interesting mileage numbers?

Let's make it so Bob never misses another interesting number. We've hacked into his car's computer, and we have a box hooked up that reads mileage numbers. We've got a box glued to his dash that lights up yellow or green depending on whether it receives a 1 or a 2 (respectively).

It's up to you, intrepid warrior, to glue the parts together. Write the function that parses the mileage number input, and returns a 2 if the number is "interesting" (see below), a 1 if an interesting number occurs within the next two miles, or a 0 if the number is not interesting.

Note: In Haskell, we use No, Almost and Yes instead of 0, 1 and 2.

"Interesting" Numbers
Interesting numbers are 3-or-more digit numbers that meet one or more of the following criteria:

Any digit followed by all zeros: 100, 90000
Every digit is the same number: 1111
The digits are sequential, incementing†: 1234
The digits are sequential, decrementing‡: 4321
The digits are a palindrome: 1221 or 73837
The digits match one of the values in the awesome_phrases array
† For incrementing sequences, 0 should come after 9, and not before 1, as in 7890.
‡ For decrementing sequences, 0 should come after 1, and not before 9, as in 3210.

So, you should expect these inputs and outputs:
